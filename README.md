# Scheduler
My first attempt at creating a variable timer for a single event

The intention is for a timer to fire an event. A simple on/off. But the timer will occur about 20 times in a day. Additionally, the function will eventually include a variable schedule (selectable per day with either a default timer or retain the last setting) and even a schedule builder.
